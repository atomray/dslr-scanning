# Status and Roadmap

## Current Status

- XY Plane printed and constructed, stepper motors attached
- Arduino UNO R3 used to control hardware - coded to:
  - use the joystick to drive the two motors when 'enabled' using the joystick switch
  - read Serial input to trigger the pattern of moving the table and firing the LED
  - finalize the positioning and step sizes of the automated motion - X and Y motions for a total of nine images

## Road Map

### Towards an MVP

- how to "break out" of the automated motion in the middle of a slide
- base to attach the XY place to

### Next Steps

- need to make one of the stepper slides longer - not long enough for the 6x9cm negatives
- use a sturdy base and essentially build a copy stand - places sell them but it seems like a DIY version
  is a good starting point

### Future Ideas

- connect / disconnect the USB to trigger a connection (would still need to select "Storage mode" on the camera
- explore what can be automated once the USB is connected
  - transfer to SSD
  - move partials into a folder
  - create panorama using Lightroom
  - apply Negative Lab Pro defaults and export preview images
